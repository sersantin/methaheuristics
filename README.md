 #How-to-Use
 First of all you can clone or download this project to your PC.
 
 After this you can select from two initial problems on which to work on.

Once selected, we must decide the metaheuristic.

 Ready, the program will begin to execute calculations generating the best solutions to the problem.
 
 _**Note:**_
In case of selecting as a solution, Variable Neighborhood Search, we must select the maximum number of neighbors.
